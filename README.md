# About Me

## Who I Am
I am a Computer Science Major, graduating in 2024, with a passion for creating impactful software. My journey in the world of programming has led me to explore a variety of languages and technologies, with a special fondness for JavaScript, Python, and C/C++.

## My Passion for JavaScript
JavaScript stands out as my favorite language. Its versatility in creating reactive web applications fascinates me. I find immense satisfaction in deploying applications on the web and witnessing people interact with my creations through a simple link. 

## Exploring Data Science with Python
Python has opened the doors to the world of data science for me. I'm particularly intrigued by Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. Experimenting with open-source projects like Stable Diffusion has been an enlightening experience, further fueling my interest in this field.

## C/C++: The Gateway to Low-Level Programming
My affinity for C/C++ stems from its close interaction with hardware and lower-level system operations. Working on projects like shell parsers, file management, and efficient space management (and occasionally tackling segmentation faults) has been both challenging and exhilarating.
