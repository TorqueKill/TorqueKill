## About Me:
Computer Science major 2024, worked on Python, C/C++, JavaScript. JavaScript is probably my favourite mainly due to the  ability to deploy a reactive application on web (I like the idea of putting something on the web and then for people to use it from just a link). Interested in data science with Python, particularly Machine Learning and Deep Learning models (playing around with the open source Stable Diffusion is such a privilege). Really like C/C++ as a language, working with hardware directly and working on the lower level is exciting especially working on shell parsers/file managment and ~~segmentation faults~~ free space managment.
